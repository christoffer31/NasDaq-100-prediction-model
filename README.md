# NasDaq-100-prediction-model
Prediction Nasdaq 100 growth trend pattern. 

Actual stockprice:  8984.858398
My model predicted: 8320.885

The model is close to the actual stock price but, it is not able to predict real market changes other than the upward trend that have we have seen in the past 100 years. So it is not all that usefull. Where it gets more usefull is when we start comparing different markets or stocks. As an example if we compare this to S&P 500 we see that NasDaq 100 tend to yield a better return, but I haven't finished that project yet so i will probably upload that soon in the future.
